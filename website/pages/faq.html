      <b>Why Does my ZCL/BTCP Balance seem inaccurate for the time I have been mining?</b></p>
    <p class="q">
      The current blocks have to confirm fully ( After 100 Confirmations ) Then payments are processed and your balance will update accordingly. Please see the <a href="https://fund.zclassic.org/stats">Graph Stats</a> Page and look at current blocks found, blocks must be fully confirmed before payment processing occurs.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use a Z address to mine to this pool?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      No you will need to use a transparent address for mining to the pool, keep in mind this is how we will keep record of what you have mined and the amount of BTCP that you will get. You will need the private key to the address you mine with to receive your
      BTCP after the fork.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use an exchange address to mine with?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      You will need to use an address that is in a wallet where you have control of the private key. Make sure you save this address and backup the private key as you will need both to redeem your BTCP after the fork.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Why do i keep getting an Unauthorized or Authorization failed error message?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      You have to use a (transparent) T address as the user in your mining program, You cannot use a Z address or an exchange address. Also make sure that the address is valid as most authorization errors have been due to mistyping the address or case sensitive issues. Copy and paste whole t address when possible for best result and if you get authorization errors double check your address. Your address can be in the format of ( t_address.workername ) and you should connect with no problems.</p>
